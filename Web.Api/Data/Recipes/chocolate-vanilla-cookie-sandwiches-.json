  "Body": "I have been a big big fan of Tarek Malouf, founder of The Hummingbird Bakery, for a while now. I own a copy of all four of his cookbooks and used some of my 24 hours in London to search out his bakery and scoff my face with sugary goodness. \nI am a frequent maker of his loaves, cupcakes and cakes but it dawned on me that I hadn\u2019t had the pleasure of giving his cookies a whirl. What a crime!\n\nThis recipe caught my eye immediately (not kidding, these bad boys are on the front cover of \u2018Life is Sweet\u2019) and I had to make them. \n\nThese are the right amount of crunchy on the outside, chewy in the middle, sandwiched with a great vanilla buttercream that smooshes out the side as you try to eat them delicately. \n\nAs always I have converted this recipe to be gluten free but feel free to swap the GF flour out for standard, and I\u2019ve adjusted the icing sugar in the buttercream icing back to a non-American sugar coma level.",
