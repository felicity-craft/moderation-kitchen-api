  "Body": "Now, you may feel like this is an exaggeration however if, like me, you have tried multiple recipes in the past claiming to be made with healthier ingredients that will hit the spot just like a classic choc chip will do, only to be hugely disappointed by the mound of dry almond meal with hardly any flavour claiming to be said cookie, then this is your cookie.\n\nDetermination struck and I created the following recipe on a whim one day by pulling all of my baking knowledge combined with some great ingredients from my mum\u2019s well stocked family pantry (thanks mum).\nThe result is a soft cookie that is buttery sans the butter, sweet minus the regular sugar and keeps fantastically well in the fridge for a few days. \nYou can mix in whatever you feel like or have on hand. \nMy preference is to go with something crunchy - toasted pecans, something melty - dark chocolate and something chewy - dried apricots.
