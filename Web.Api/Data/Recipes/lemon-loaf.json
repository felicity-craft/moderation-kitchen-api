  "Body": "I think that it is essential to have a good loaf recipe in your back pocket.\nYou know those times when people decide to drop round last minute - this is perfect for that.\nThe smell of lemon permeates the air in the most lovely way. Combine that with the smell of baked goods and you\u0027re onto a winner of a welcomer.\nThis can be easily taken to the next level with the addition of some fresh thyme leaves - 2 Tbsp chopped into the batter, and 3 sprigs added to the syrup.",
