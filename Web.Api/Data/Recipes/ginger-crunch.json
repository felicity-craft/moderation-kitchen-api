  "Body": "My rocking Nana Joan is still baking ginger crunch on a regular basis for the family visitors every weekend, even though she is a young 95 and has every right to pass the ginger crunch making buck onto someone else.\n\nCrunchy buttery biscuit base, topped with an equal layer of one hell of a ginger punch icing, the following recipe quickly became a farmers market favourite for The Sweet Eatery, a previous business of mine. In fact, we had one lady who at first put her nose up to it for being GF, however upon trying it she became quite a regular purchasing at least 4 slices every week. Yep that\u0027s right people, don\u0027t knock it before you try it!\n\nWell Nana Joan, let\u0027s continue spreading the love for this kiwi classic shall we?",
