  "Body": "While I sit here listening to my folksy/pop faves You\u002BMe, sipping on my now cold coffee, trying to suss out why I love this cake so much, it dawns on me that it\u0027s really the simplicity of it.\u00A0That and it tastes bloody delicious. This cake is also the clear winner on the birthday choice front for my other half/photo\u00A0extraordinaire Isaac, picking it every year for a good 10 years.\n\nWhat makes this beauty even more appealing is the fact that it is a one bowl, quick mix cake. I mean who really has the time to do the equivalent of a family of 6\u0027s dishes every time a cake is made. I sure don\u0027t. Nah uh, no way.\n\nI stumbled upon this recipe years ago and over time have converted it to be\u00A0safe for us gluten free folks. I love that it\u0027s not fussy, with no added extras that blur the line between carrot and hummingbird cakes. It is carrot cake in its purest form. The best form. Why fix what\u0027s not broken eh? The final flourish is a good helping of the best cream cheese icing I have ever used, cleverly created by the team at Miette.\n\nNotes:\u2028\nYou are more than welcome to switch out the flour to GF pre-mix from the supermarket. Just make sure to check if it has raising agents or gums in it already, if so, adjust the recipe accordingly.",
