  "Body": "This recipe eventuated from endless hours of researching the science behind the humble chocolate chip cookie. Brown sugar and melted butter for chew, an extra egg yolk to keep the cookie fudgy, chopping the chocolate into chunks and flakes for little pockets of melted goodness, and on and on and on. Who would have thought it\u0027s all so technical?! What makes it even more complex is converting it to being gluten free! Let\u0027s just say that there were many many failures in testing.\n\nYes I know that the ingredient list is rather long but trust me, it is well worth the effort to get the perfect gluten free cookie.\n\nChilling the dough overnight is another must!",
